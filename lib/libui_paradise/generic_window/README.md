The main purpose of the class in this directory is to provide
a simplified toplevel window for the libui_paradise gem. That
way a user can directly tap into this, or use the base class
called LibuiParadise::GUI::LibUI::Base, to quickly display a
window.

I needed this functionality in September 2022 to quickly 
show a "Backup has finished!" message on windows specifically,
to indicate that backup has, well - finished.
