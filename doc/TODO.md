- Make sure that each component has a screenshot. It's ok to
  re-use existing screenshots from other projects.

- Make sure the project is API compatible to glimmer-libui.

- Rewrite the project from the get-go. Also integrate 
  @main_window into the main hash, rather than have it
  standalone. ^^^ this should be fixed ASAP - it is not
  elegant to have a separate @main_window ... but for
  now we'll keep it as-is.

- Re-organize the examples, perhaps starting with another
  one.

- Check for image and font support again. Something isn't
  working!
